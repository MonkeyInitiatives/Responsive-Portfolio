        <p>Hello! My name is Tom Woods and I am a student at Penn Coding Bootcamp. This is my first website using HTML and CSS. It is very exciting!</p> 
        <p>I enjoy watching movies, playing video games, and learning about computers. My favorite movies are Chungking Express, There Will Be Blood, and both Godfather movies (the third one doesn't exist). I once beat Super Mario Bros in 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Not too shabby!</p>
        <p>Recently, I moved to Philadelphia. It's a beautiful city, but everyone drives too fast and too close to one another. Maybe when this class is completed, I will get used to it, or I'll create a beatiful website to explain how to properly merge on highways!</p>
